# @nvlabs-org/orchestrator

Multi-agent team collaboration engine. Manages agent lifecycles, task delegation, phase transitions, preview detection, and result finalization — all behind a typed event-driven API.

## Architecture

```
                        +-----------------------+
                        |    Orchestrator        |
                        |  (EventEmitter)        |
                        +-----------+-----------+
                                    |
          +------------+------------+------------+------------+
          |            |            |            |            |
   AgentManager  DelegationRouter PhaseMachine ResultFinalizer PreviewResolver
   (sessions)    (task routing)   (phases)     (team merge)   (URL resolve)
          |            |
     AgentSession  PromptEngine
     (process mgr) (templates)
```

**Key design decisions:**
- Orchestrator is a **pure logic library** — no I/O, no HTTP, no persistence. The consumer (gateway) handles all external concerns.
- All communication via **typed events** (`EventEmitter<OrchestratorEventMap>`). The consumer subscribes and forwards to its own transport (WebSocket, Ably, etc.).
- **AI-backend agnostic** — any CLI that accepts a prompt and outputs text can be wrapped as an `AIBackend`.

```

### Execute Phase Detail

```
Leader (no tools, delegates only)
  |
  | @Dev: Build the game with PixiJS...
  v
Developer (full tools)
  |  writes code, runs build, reports ENTRY_FILE
  v
Leader receives result
  |
  | @Reviewer: Check the code, verify features...
  v
Code Reviewer (full tools)
  |  VERDICT: PASS or FAIL + ISSUES
  |
  +-- PASS --> Leader --> FINAL SUMMARY (isFinalResult = true)
  |
  +-- FAIL (1st time) --> Direct Fix: Dev fixes issues, Reviewer re-reviews
  |                       (skips Leader — saves time and tokens)
  |
  +-- FAIL (2nd time) --> Escalate to Leader for strategic decision
```

### Direct Fix Shortcut (Reviewer → Dev)

When a reviewer returns `VERDICT: FAIL`, the system uses a **tiered shortcut** to avoid unnecessary Leader round-trips:

1. **First FAIL** — routes directly to the developer with the reviewer's full feedback (`fullOutput`). Developer fixes issues and the reviewer automatically re-reviews. Leader is not involved.
2. **Second FAIL** — escalates to the Leader, who can decide to try a different approach, reassign, or accept as-is.

This saves 2 Leader AI calls per successful fix cycle (one for forwarding FAIL, one for forwarding the fix result). The `maxDirectFixes` config controls how many direct fix attempts are allowed before escalation (default: 1).

**VERDICT detection**: The `DelegationRouter` matches `VERDICT: FAIL` from the reviewer's `fullOutput` (not the truncated summary), ensuring reliable detection regardless of output format.

All existing safety limits still apply: `maxReviewRounds` (3), `budgetRounds` (7), and `hardCeilingRounds` (10) prevent infinite loops.

### Delegation Controls

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `maxDepth` | 5 | Max delegation chain hops |
| `maxTotal` | 20 | Total delegations per session |
| `budgetRounds` | 7 | Leader invocations before forced finalize |
| `hardCeilingRounds` | 10 | Absolute max rounds (synthetic task:done) |
| `maxReviewRounds` | 3 | Code review iterations before accepting |
| `maxDirectFixes` | 1 | Direct fix attempts (reviewer→dev) before escalating to leader |

## Agent Memory

Persistent cross-project learning system. Agents improve over time by remembering patterns from previous projects.

### What Gets Remembered

| Memory Type | Recorded When | Injected Into |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Review Patterns** | Reviewer outputs `VERDICT: FAIL` with numbered issues | Dev worker prompts (when same issue flagged ≥2 times) |
| **Tech Preferences** | Project completes with a `TECH:` line in the approved plan | Dev worker prompts (last 3 preferences shown) |
| **Project History** | `isFinalResult` fires on team completion | Stored for reference (not injected into prompts) |

### How It Works

- Storage: `~/.nvlabs-org[-dev]/data/memory/memory.json` (human-readable, persists across restarts)
- Memory is **global**, not per-agent — all dev workers in any team share the same learned context
- Only recurring patterns are injected (count ≥ 2), so one-off issues don't pollute prompts
- Review patterns are capped at top 20, tech preferences at last 10, project history at last 50

### Example Memory Injection

After two projects where the reviewer flagged "missing build step" and "no error handling in fetch calls", the next dev worker's prompt will include:

```
===== LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS PROJECTS =====
COMMON REVIEW ISSUES (avoid these):
- missing build step (flagged 2x)
- no error handling in fetch calls (flagged 3x)

USER'S PREFERRED TECH: Vanilla JS + Canvas, React + Tailwind
```

### API

```typescript
import { getMemoryStore, clearMemory } from "@nvlabs-org/orchestrator";

// Inspect current memory
const store = getMemoryStore();
console.log(store.reviewPatterns);  // [{ pattern: "...", count: 3, lastSeen: ... }]
console.log(store.techPreferences); // ["Vanilla JS + Canvas", "React + Tailwind"]
console.log(store.projectHistory);  // [{ summary: "...", tech: "...", completedAt: ... }]

// Reset all memory
clearMemory();
```

## Worktree Isolation

When multiple agents work on the same repo, each agent gets its own **git worktree** — a physical copy of the working tree linked to the same repo, on its own branch. This prevents agents from stepping on each other's changes.

### Design Principles

- **One agent = one worktree = one branch.** Worktree and branch are keyed by `agentId`, not `taskId`. This keeps the directory stable across tasks so Claude Code `--resume` works (same CWD).
- **Worktrees live outside the repo** at `~/.nvlabs-org[-dev]/worktrees/<repo-hash>/<agentId>/`. This prevents Claude Code from traversing up to the main repo root.
- **Branch naming:** `agent/<agentName>-<shortId>` (e.g. `agent/nova-pTTERq`). Unique per agent, human-readable.
- **Branches are local only** — never pushed to remote. Visible in SourceTree/git tools via shared `.git`.

### Lifecycle

```
Agent gets task
  │
  ├─ worktree exists? ──yes──> syncWorktreeToMain (rebase onto latest main)
  │                             skipped if pendingMerge=true
  │
  └─ no ──> git worktree add ~/.nvlabs-org[-dev]/worktrees/<repo>/<agentId>
            creates branch agent/<name>-<id>
            session.clearHistory() (can't --resume in new CWD)
  │
  v
Agent works in worktree (commits on its branch)
  │
  v
Task completes (task:done)
  ├─ autoMerge=true (default):
  │    auto-commit → squash-merge → main
  │    reset branch to main HEAD (keepAlive)
  │    commitHash pushed to mergeCommitStack (for undo)
  │
  ├─ autoMerge=false (deferred):
  │    auto-commit → set pendingMerge=true
  │    UI shows merge/revert buttons, user decides when to merge
  │
  └─ Team worker: merge all at once when team finalizes
  │
  v
Agent removed (fired)
  └─ git worktree remove + git branch -D (full cleanup)
```

### Merge Control (per-agent)

Each agent has a per-agent `autoMerge` toggle (default: **true**) in the UI chat area.

**Auto-merge flow (default):**
1. Task completes → auto-commit + squash-merge to main → record commitHash
2. Test the changes in the running app
3. If broken → click **undo merge** (red button, shows confirmation with commit hash + message)
4. Can undo multiple merges — each undo pops one from the commit stack

**Deferred merge flow (autoMerge=false):**
1. Task completes → auto-commit to agent branch → `pendingMerge=true`
2. UI shows **merge to main** (green) + **revert** (yellow) buttons
3. **revert** = `git reset --hard HEAD~1` on agent branch (undo last agent commit, can click multiple times)
4. **merge to main** = squash-merge when ready
5. After merge, **undo merge** button appears (same as auto-merge flow)

**UI Controls (chat input area, both sidebar and console mode):**
- **merge to main** (green): squash-merge agent branch → main
- **revert** (yellow): undo last agent commit on branch (pre-merge)
- **undo merge** (red): `git revert <commitHash>` on main (post-merge, with confirmation dialog)
- **auto-merge** checkbox: toggle per-agent autoMerge preference
- All buttons disabled while agent is working

### Conflict Resolution

Conflicts are resolved automatically — no user intervention needed.

| Scenario | Strategy | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Sync (before task)** | `-X theirs` (main wins) | Agent hasn't started new work; main is authoritative |
| **Merge (to main)** | `-X ours` (agent wins) | Agent's changes are the content being merged |

Both follow the same 3-tier approach:
1. Clean rebase (no auto-resolve)
2. If conflicts → rebase with strategy (`-X theirs` or `-X ours`)
3. If still fails → report error

### Dirty Files Safety

All merge/undo operations stash uncommitted files on main before operating, and restore them after:
- `mergeWorktree`: stash → merge → pop (on both success and failure paths)
- `undoMergeCommit`: stash → revert → pop (via try/finally)

### Cleanup

Worktrees are cleaned up only when an agent is **fired** (`removeAgent`). No startup GC — worktrees carry meaningful unmerged state that must survive gateway restarts. On restart, `detectPendingMerges()` scans existing worktrees and sets `pendingMerge=true` if they have uncommitted changes or commits ahead of main.

### Commands & Events

| Command | Params | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `MERGE_WORKTREE` | agentId | Manually merge agent's worktree to main |
| `REVERT_WORKTREE` | agentId | Undo last commit on agent's branch |
| `UNDO_MERGE` | agentId | Revert the last merge commit on main |
| `TOGGLE_AUTO_MERGE` | agentId, autoMerge | Toggle per-agent auto-merge |

| Event | Key Fields | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| `worktree:created` | agentId, worktreePath, branch | Git worktree created |
| `worktree:merged` | agentId, success, commitHash?, commitMessage? | Worktree squash-merged to main |
| `worktree:ready` | agentId, branch | Worktree has changes ready for manual merge |
| `autoMerge:updated` | agentId, autoMerge, lastMergeCommit? | Per-agent merge preference changed |

**State persistence:**
- `autoMerge`: persisted in `team-state.json`, restored on restart
- `pendingMerge`: reconstructed from git state on restart via `detectPendingMerges()`
- `mergeCommitStack`: rebuilt from git log on restart via `getMergeHistory()` — undo survives restarts

### Configuration

```typescript
const orc = createOrchestrator({
  worktree: {
    mergeOnComplete: true,    // enable worktree merge infrastructure
    alwaysIsolate: true,      // create worktree even for solo agents
  },
  // or: worktree: false      // disable worktree isolation entirely
});
// Per-agent: session.autoMerge (default: true)
```

```

## Preview Resolution

When a task completes, preview URL is resolved through a **7-step cascading fallback**:

```
1. PREVIEW_CMD + PREVIEW_PORT  -->  Run server, proxy via port
2. PREVIEW_CMD (no port)       -->  Desktop/CLI app (user launches manually)
3. ENTRY_FILE (.html)          -->  Static serve via npx serve:9100
4. "PREVIEW: http://..." in stdout  -->  Explicit URL from agent
5. .html path mentioned in stdout   -->  Regex extraction
6. .html in changedFiles       -->  Static serve
7. Build output scan           -->  dist/index.html, build/index.html, etc.
```

At the team level, `ResultFinalizer` adds two additional layers before this chain:
- **Worker ground truth** — dev worker's preview fields override leader's (leader often hallucinates filenames)
- **Worker detectPreview scan** — iterate all workers' output for preview URLs

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { createOrchestrator } from "@nvlabs-org/orchestrator";
import type { AIBackend } from "@nvlabs-org/orchestrator";

const claude: AIBackend = {
  id: "claude",
  name: "Claude",
  command: "claude",
  buildArgs(prompt, opts) {
    const args = ["-p", prompt, "--output-format", "stream-json"];
    if (opts.continue && opts.resumeSessionId) args.push("--resume", opts.resumeSessionId);
    if (opts.fullAccess) args.push("--dangerously-skip-permissions");
    if (opts.noTools) args.push("--allowedTools", "");
    return args;
  },
};

const orc = createOrchestrator({
  workspace: "/path/to/workspace",
  backends: [claude],
  retry: { maxRetries: 2, escalateToLeader: true },
  promptsDir: "~/.my-app/prompts",  // optional: override prompt templates on disk
});
```

### Event Handling

```typescript
// All 16 event types are fully typed
orc.on("task:started", (e) => {
  console.log(`${e.agentId} started task ${e.taskId}`);
});

orc.on("task:done", (e) => {
  if (e.isFinalResult) {
    console.log("Team finished!", e.result?.previewUrl);
  }
});

orc.on("team:phase", (e) => {
  console.log(`${e.teamId}: phase -> ${e.phase}`);
});

orc.on("team:chat", (e) => {
  // messageType: "delegation" | "result" | "status"
  console.log(`[${e.messageType}] ${e.fromAgentId}: ${e.message}`);
});
```

### Solo Agent

```typescript
orc.createAgent({
  agentId: "agent-1",
  name: "Dev",
  role: "Developer",
});

orc.runTask("agent-1", "task-1", "Build a landing page");
```

### Team Workflow

```typescript
// 1. Create agents
orc.createAgent({ agentId: "lead-1", name: "PM", role: "Team Lead" });
orc.createAgent({ agentId: "dev-1",  name: "Leo", role: "Developer" });
orc.createAgent({ agentId: "rev-1",  name: "Ada", role: "Code Reviewer" });
orc.setTeamLead("lead-1");

// 2. Start in CREATE phase — leader produces a [PLAN]
orc.setTeamPhase("team-1", "create", "lead-1");
orc.runTask("lead-1", "task-1", "Build a pixel snake game", {
  phaseOverride: "create",
});

// 3. Leader outputs [PLAN] -> auto-transitions to DESIGN phase
// 4. User reviews plan, provides feedback or approves

// 5. Approve plan -> transitions to EXECUTE phase
orc.approvePlan("lead-1");
orc.setTeamProjectDir("/workspace/snake-game");
orc.runTask("lead-1", "task-2", "Start building", {
  phaseOverride: "execute",
});

// 6. Leader delegates to Dev, Dev builds, Reviewer reviews
//    All handled automatically by DelegationRouter

// 7. isFinalResult fires on task:done -> COMPLETE phase
// 8. User sends feedback -> auto-transitions back to EXECUTE
```

### State Persistence (Consumer Side)

```typescript
// Save
const agents = orc.getAllAgents();
const phases = orc.getAllTeamPhases();
const projectDir = orc.getTeamProjectDir();
fs.writeFileSync("state.json", JSON.stringify({ agents, phases, projectDir }));

// Restore
const state = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("state.json", "utf-8"));
for (const agent of state.agents) {
  orc.createAgent({ ...agent, resumeHistory: true });
  if (agent.isTeamLead) orc.setTeamLead(agent.agentId);
}
for (const phase of state.phases) {
  orc.setTeamPhase(phase.teamId, phase.phase, phase.leadAgentId);
}
if (state.projectDir) orc.setTeamProjectDir(state.projectDir);
```

## Configuration

All magic numbers are centralized in `config.ts`:

```typescript
import { CONFIG } from "@nvlabs-org/orchestrator";

CONFIG.delegation.maxDepth          // 5
CONFIG.delegation.maxTotal          // 20
CONFIG.delegation.budgetRounds      // 7
CONFIG.delegation.hardCeilingRounds // 10
CONFIG.delegation.maxReviewRounds   // 3
CONFIG.delegation.maxDirectFixes    // 1 (direct reviewer→dev fix attempts before leader)

CONFIG.timing.leaderTimeoutMs       // 3 min
CONFIG.timing.workerTimeoutMs       // 8 min
CONFIG.timing.resultBatchWindowMs   // 20s (safety net for batch flushing)
CONFIG.timing.idleDoneDelayMs       // 5s
CONFIG.timing.idleErrorDelayMs      // 3s

CONFIG.preview.staticPort           // 9100
CONFIG.preview.buildOutputCandidates // ["dist/index.html", ...]
CONFIG.preview.runners              // { ".py": "python3", ".js": "node", ... }
```

## Prompt Templates

15 templates with compile-time typed names (`TemplateName` union). Templates are embedded as defaults and optionally overridden from disk (`promptsDir`).

| Template | Phase | Used When |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `leader-create` | CREATE | First turn: leader as Creative Director |
| `leader-create-continue` | CREATE | Follow-up conversation |
| `leader-design` | DESIGN | User provides plan feedback |
| `leader-design-continue` | DESIGN | Continued refinement |
| `leader-initial` | EXECUTE | First execute entry (full delegation rules) |
| `leader-continue` | EXECUTE | Follow-up execute (keeps context) |
| `leader-result` | EXECUTE | Leader receives worker/reviewer results |
| `leader-complete` | COMPLETE | Present results to user |
| `leader-complete-continue` | COMPLETE | User feedback on completion |
| `worker-initial` | EXECUTE | Developer task assignment |
| `worker-reviewer-initial` | EXECUTE | Code reviewer task |
| `worker-continue` | EXECUTE | Follow-up to worker |
| `worker-direct-fix` | EXECUTE | Direct fix after reviewer FAIL (skips leader) |
| `delegation-prefix` | EXECUTE | Wraps delegated task prompts |
| `delegation-hint` | EXECUTE | Delegation syntax helper |

Templates use `{{variable}}` substitution. Key variables include `{{memory}}` (injected from Agent Memory for dev workers) and `{{soloHint}}` (solo mode instructions). Override any template by placing a `<template-name>.md` file in `promptsDir`.

## Owner Metadata (Multi-Instance Safety)

Each worktree has an owner file at `<worktreeDir>/.owners/<agentId>.json`:

```typescript
interface WorktreeOwnerInfo {
  gatewayId: string;
  machineId: string;
  instanceDir: string;
  pid: number;
  startedAt: number;
  agentId: string;
  agentName: string;
  branch: string;
  repoRoot: string;
}
```

This enables safe cleanup across multiple gateway instances (Tauri / Web / CLI). A worktree is only cleaned up if its owning runtime is dead (PID check + heartbeat TTL via `RuntimeOwnerInfo`). The `shouldCleanWorktree()` function checks:
1. Same gateway instance + same startedAt → clean (stale from previous run)
2. Owner's runtime PID is dead or heartbeat expired → clean
3. Otherwise → skip (another live instance owns it)

## Activity Board (Real-time Awareness)

When multiple agents work concurrently, they need awareness of each other's activities.

### Event Protocol

```typescript
interface AgentActivityEvent {
  type: "agent:activity";
  agentId: string;
  agentName: string;
  intent: string;       // Task description (first CONFIG.limits.intentChars chars)
  phase: "started" | "completed";
}
```

### Broadcast Points
- **Delegation start** (`delegation.ts`): emitted when a worker receives a task
- **Task completion** (`delegation.ts`): emitted when a worker returns a result

### Worker Team Context

Workers receive a lightweight team awareness block (~30 tokens per peer) via `buildWorkerTeamContext()`:

```
===== TEAM AWARENESS =====
Your teammates (for context -- do NOT delegate or coordinate with them):
- Leo (Developer) [working] -- feat: implement game loop...
- Ada (Code Reviewer) [idle]
```

This shows peer names, roles, statuses, and last results — enough to avoid file conflicts without overwhelming the prompt.

## Persistence

### Agent State

File: `~/.nvlabs-org[-dev]/data/instances/<id>/team-state.json` (instance-scoped)

```typescript
interface PersistedAgent {
  agentId: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  personality?: string;
  backend?: string;
  palette?: number;
  teamId?: string;
  isTeamLead?: boolean;
  workDir?: string;
  worktreePath?: string | null;
  worktreeBranch?: string | null;
  autoMerge?: boolean;
}

interface PersistedTeam {
  teamId: string;

```

- Saved on: CREATE_AGENT, FIRE_AGENT, team:phase changes, gateway shutdown
- Atomic write via tmp file + rename (prevents truncation on kill)
- `loadTeamState()` restores all agents on startup (no filtering)
- Solo agents are NOT removed when creating a team

### Session Context
- Agent sessions store agentId -> Claude Code session ID mapping
- Conversation history lives in `~/.claude/projects/` (managed by Claude Code)
- On restart: `--resume <sessionId>` continues the conversation
- Session IDs should NOT be cleared — causes context loss

### Project History

File: `~/.nvlabs-org[-dev]/data/project-history/<startedAt>-<name>.json`

Completed projects are archived with all events, agents, team state, preview info, token usage, and ratings. Event buffer is persisted to `project-events.jsonl` (instance-scoped) so archives survive gateway restarts.

## External Agent Output

External agents (detected by process scanner) bypass the orchestrator entirely:
- Output read from `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL files by `external-output-reader.ts`
- Text blocks sent as LOG_APPEND events (no truncation, 500ms throttle)
- Frontend accumulates chunks into growing messages (10s window per message block)
- No TASK_DONE event — streaming messages are the final display

## Console Mode (UI)

Terminal-style chat interface with CRT effects:
- **Layout**: Left vertical tab bar (Agents/Team/External) + top horizontal agent strip + full-height chat
- **Visual**: JetBrains Mono font, green terminal theme (#18ff62), CRT scanlines, screen flicker
- **Messages**: Terminal log format with timestamps and agent name tags `[Marcus]`
- **Input**: Always-visible `>` prompt, ESC to stop working agent, type to continue
- **Streaming**: Real-time output via LOG_APPEND, typewriter reveal effect
- **Completion**: Duration display (e.g. "Brewed for 1m 45s")
- **Working indicator**: Animated dots `...` in streaming message, `>_` when idle
- **Console toggle**: Button on sidebar left edge, expands chat to full screen (unmounts PixiJS scene)

## Team Execution Notes

- Leader's non-delegation responses in execute phase are treated as conversational replies (marked `isFinalResult`, phase returns to complete)
- Streaming messages (`-stream` suffix) are cleaned up on: TASK_DONE, TASK_FAILED, TASK_STARTED (stale cleanup), and leader intermediate completions
- Direct fix shortcut: reviewer FAIL -> dev (skip leader) -> auto re-review -> escalate to leader if still failing

## Implementation Status

| Phase | Content | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Working directory config (workDir, PICK_FOLDER, persistence) | Done |
| Phase 2 | Git worktree isolation (centralized storage, team + solo, alwaysIsolate) | Done |
| Phase 3 | Conflict detection (git merge-tree dry-run, rebase-then-retry) | Done |
| Phase 4 | Activity Board (agent:activity event, worker team context injection) | Done |
| Phase 5 | Exports/Needs dependency graph + prompt injection | Planned |

## Key File Index

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `src/worktree.ts` | Git worktree CRUD + env isolation -- `createWorktree` (centralized), `mergeWorktree` (squash + rebase-retry), `removeWorktree`, `checkConflicts` (git 2.38+ with fallback), `cleanupStaleWorktrees` (owner-aware), `getIsolatedGitEnv`, `syncWorktreeToMain`, `undoMergeCommit`, `resetWorktreeToMain`, `revertWorktreeCommit`, `getMergeHistory`, `initGitRepo` |
| `src/delegation.ts` | `DelegationRouter` -- `prepareWorktree` callback, batched result forwarding, direct fix shortcut (reviewer->dev->re-review), budget/ceiling enforcement, worker team context |
| `src/orchestrator.ts` | Core engine -- `prepareWorktree()`, `hasSoloNeighbor()`, `alwaysIsolate`, `mergeAllWorktrees()`, `detectPendingMerges()`, `undoMerge()`, `setAutoMerge()`, `manualMerge()`, `revertLastCommit()` |
| `src/agent-session.ts` | Process management -- `worktreePath`/`worktreeBranch` storage, CWD resolution (worktree > repoPath > workspace), stale worktree auto-clear, conditional cleanup on failure |
| `src/memory.ts` | Persistent learning -- review patterns, tech prefs, project history |
| `src/phase-machine.ts` | State machine: CREATE -> DESIGN -> EXECUTE -> COMPLETE |
| `src/result-finalizer.ts` | Team merge: changedFiles, preview, entryFile |
| `src/preview-resolver.ts` | 7-step cascading preview URL resolution |
| `src/prompt-templates.ts` | 15 typed templates (leader/worker/reviewer/direct-fix) |
| `src/config.ts` | Centralized constants (delegation, timing, preview, limits) |
| `apps/gateway/src/index.ts` | Gateway -- `agentWorkDirs`, `git init` on APPROVE_PLAN, event forwarding, `worktreeEnabled` toggle |
| `apps/gateway/src/team-state.ts` | State persistence -- instance-scoped, atomic write, project history archive |
| `apps/gateway/src/external-output-reader.ts` | External agent output -- JSONL reader, 500ms throttle |
| `apps/web/src/app/office/page.tsx` | UI -- console layout, terminal messages, typewriter effect |
| `apps/web/src/store/office-store.ts` | Store -- streaming message lifecycle, external agent text accumulation |

## Rejected Approaches

| Approach | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| CRDTs (Yjs/Automerge) | AI agents write entire files, not character-by-character edits -- wrong abstraction level |
| Python frameworks (MetaGPT/CrewAI) | Not Node.js native, and they don't solve file conflicts |
| Pure file locking (no worktree) | LLM agents are unpredictable -- they may ignore locks and write files directly |
| Custom merge algorithms | Git's three-way merge is already optimal -- no need to reinvent the wheel |
| External clash CLI | Native `git merge-tree` achieves the same goal without extra dependencies |
| Clearing session on error | Causes context loss -- session should be preserved for retry |
| In-repo `.worktrees/` directory | Path traversal issues -- agents walk up to find project root and hit worktree dirs |
| Startup GC for stale worktrees | Could destroy worktrees with pending unmerged changes -- replaced by owner-aware cleanup |
